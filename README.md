# ðŸŽ® Unity Notes

Here are notes created when I am learning [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/) to create a **2D game**. 

## ðŸ’¡ Introduction

Here are notes about learning unity. I did not follow a textbook or series of videos, just cases by cases to learn. But I will try to make the learning tree clear and structured. 

The notes more likly show how to do something, step by step, linear processes. This would be helpful in reality practice. Whenever we forget how to implement a function, we just refer the notes to review. As for the usage for exact single function, I prefer to referring the official document, so I will not focus on understanding all part of a function, just use it. 

Notes will be archived by different classifications, depend on the role in a game, like environment, player, etc.

For finding some reference codes, there is a script folder contain all scripts to help.
